##User requirements document##
We are a small newly formed Project management business. As a new business we would like a tailor-made, in-house piece of software that is user friendly and allow us to work within the Scrum framework. There are five employees within the business operation within one buoilding,  however we are often on location and it is possible we have several projects on the go at any one time.

Multiple users should be able to individually log into the system at any one time and update the various projects.

Our business will open on the 20th March 2020 and we would like the software in place by the 14th of March 2020 so we can familiarise our staff with it.
